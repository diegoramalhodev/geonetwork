Overview
########

The GeoNetwork project started out in year 2001 as a Spatial Data Catalogue System for
the Food and Agriculture organisation of the United Nations (`FAO <http://www.fao.org>`_),
the United Nations World Food Programme (`WFP <http://www.wfp.org>`_) and the
United Nations Environmental Programme (`UNEP <http://www.unep.org>`_).

At present the project is widely used as the basis of Spatial Data Infrastructures
all around the world.

The project is part of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (`OSGeo <http://www.osgeo.org>`_) and
can be found at `GeoNetwork opensource <http://geonetwork-opensource.org>`_.

These docs are organized into specific guides targeting different audience:
